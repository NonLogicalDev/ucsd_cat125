# CAT 125 Final Project

This is my final project for CAT 125 class at UCSD. The website is about
Demoscene and graphics, written in AngularJS and NodeJS.

AngularJS is used for frontend page generation and routing. NodeJS is
resposible for backend and provides api that delivers content to frontend. I am
also using Jade for HTML and SCSS for CSS.

To get this baby up and running you need to do the following:

```shell
$ npm install
$ gulp server
```

And then point your browser to localhost:3000
