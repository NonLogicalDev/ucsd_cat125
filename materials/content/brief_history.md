Coming to this page, you probably want some questions answered. It is likely
the first time you've ever heard about the [demoscene][demowiki]. Well, in
short demoscene is a bunch of passionate programmers, musicians and graphic
designers that push the limits of what is possible to make with math in the
visual art. The results of their work are self contained applications, called
demos, that users can run on their machines. When run these applications (demos)
produce audio/visual presentations.

that introduced me to the demoscene subculture.

A more formal definition of the demoscene is that it is a subculture of the
computer art, which originated from the personal computer revolution and
somewhat unexpectedly in software hacking.

Demoscene roots all the way back in 1970s when the computing landscape began to
shift from being commercial only to becoming more personal. At the time most of
the people did not have access to computers and they were thought of as
specialised machinery that was mainly used commercially. That said with efforts
on the part of Apple Computers and Commodore, computers started to find their
ways into ordinary households. With these new home computers came software and
with software came the first occurrences of software [cracking][hackvscrack]
(hacking software with the intent of circumventing protection mechanisms).

The hacker scene at the early stages was somewhat different from what it is
nowadays, although some hacker groups to this day uphold the traditions from
those times. In general when hacker groups cracked games, alongside the licence
key generator, a patch or other kind of a crack they distributed some kind of
an introduction that included the name of the group and its members and
sometimes a shoutout to other groups. These introductions often times were some
sort of cool visualisation with [chiptune][chiptunewiki] music.

Some of the hackers eventually came to a conclusion that making the intros is
more fun than actually hacking the software and solely focused on producing
those introductions. As time gone by these intro makers started to compete with
each other who can make the coolest visual audio presentation. And from there
questionable roots the demoscene was born.

This is how the demoscene cult began to shape up. Stemming from the hacker
culture beginnings it shaped into a community of enthusiast programmers,
musicians, and artists, committed to squeeze out as much graphical awesomeness
as possible out of their machines.
