For my critique I wish to comment on the the demo that I happened to see
at live at Assembly party when I was visiting home over the summer.

  <div class="descr">This demo scored the first place at the Assembly Summer 2012.</div>
</div>

I have to admit that it is a very aesthetic production. The CNCD team has gone
out their way to make this demo look so cool and complex. The procedural
landscape generation, particle system for the fog like material when the violin
is playing and the algorithms to break things apart and glitch are quite
impressive. I can see why it ended up getting the first place.

That said at the same time, it seems like it has too many things animated
and modeled by hand, which although not bad by itself, goes against the roots,
of the demoscene community. If you tried to download and run this demo, you
will notice that it comes in a whopping 150 Megabyte executable, and unless you
are an avid gamer with a pro grade gaming rig it probably will not run very 
smoothly. This is exactly the intoxication with the nearly unlimited power, 
I have been talking about in my [now and then](page/now_and_then) entry.

Aside from that, I believe the team has obsessed a tad too much with the
explode effects and with distortion. There is much that could be done with
choreography instead. The tone of the demo set up in the beginning, does not
really carry over into the rest of it. It almost seems like they started with a
very cool idea for a demo, and then sort of ran out of either steam or
enthusiasm or perhaps ideas.

I think this demo production could have been a lot more interesting if the team
behind it chose to elaborate on the ideas from the beginning; like for example
add more complicated procedural landscape and make it morph to the beats of
music as the camera flies down that road. They could also elaborate on the
origami style that they used for the violin player, like make a room that
changes its shape in origami style.

I believe as good as this piece was perceived at the party there are still 
quite a lot of things that could be improved. Starting with decreasing the 
filesize and using more runtime generated material, and perhaps improving
some of the scenes they were using to showcase their skills.
