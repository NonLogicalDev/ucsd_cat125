The demoscene community has undergone a lot of changes over the years. The
technology has been constantly changing, and so did the mindset of the
community. Computers have come long ways from where they were back when the
demoscene began to emerge, and mindset has shifted from trying to adapt to
hardware squeezing every bit of performance it could handle, to making the most
technologically advanced demos with virtually no performance limitations.

Back in the days of [Commodore64][commodore] there weren't many personal computers
variations, and even those that did exist did not vary significantly in their
speed and underlying hardware. So the contestants in competitions basically had
almost identical hardware, and that hardware was very limited in its
capabilities. The biggest way to one up competition therefore was to make your
demos the efficient as possible. That way you could have spare power to layer
up more effects or utilise more complicated effects.

Everything was limited in those days. The memory was prohibitively small to do
anything outlandishly complicated, the processors were slow, the resolution
that video cards could handle was also limited, not to mention that in the very
beginning they could not even draw pixel by pixel, so everything was drawn with
text. Sometimes to get the effects people wanted they had to use hardware
glitches, basically make hardware do what it was never intended to by
manufacturers.

These competitions that restrict people old hardware are still occasionally
held in the spirit of the old days, but it is a less mainstream branch of the
demoscene community.

As I mentioned computers have come a very long way, the processor speed, the
memory size and the graphics card power are now almost entirely limited by the
amount of money that you are willing to spend on those components. As such the
competitions by and large have shifted away from the mindset "Who can squeeze
the most out of this machine", to "who can make the most technically advanced
and visually pleasing animation".

In order to keep some of the old ideals and spirits, there are a bunch of tiers
in competitions, and few of the most widely known ones are the ones that impose
restrictions on the size of the executable that produces the animation. The
size limiting tiers are [4k(kilobytes)][4k], and [64k][64k]. These artificial restrictions
are there to keep people from being too intoxicated with the power of the
newest graphics cards and processors and virtually unlimited memory, to make
them stand back and try to find the cleverest most efficient algorithms to
generate the animations they want. These restrictions weed out the people who
are truly geniuses in programming from those that just happen to have good
creative vision and a knack for programming.
