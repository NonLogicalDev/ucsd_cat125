If you happen to be in Computer Science you occasionally might hear about
graphics from that one friend of yours that is a part of the game development
club. Or perhaps someone that tried taking a course out of curiosity. Chances
are however, computer graphics is not available as a distinct major cluster at
your college, and should you get sufficiently interested and brave to give it a
go, you might end up having trouble finding a course that is offered regularly.

All of this signals that it is a not a very popular choice of career for
people. Computer Graphics is a highly competitive field, and for those who grok
it, it is very rewarding to work in. That said, I won't be the first to say
that it is probably a field that it more suited as a hobby for most people.
Graphics is not for the faint of the heart.

The only positions, besides university research, that are available to the
graphics programmers are in the gaming industry. That industry that is
notorious for overworking people to meet the tight deadlines. Not the most
bright prospect to look forward to unless you really really love your work. But
to be honest developing games is in most cases more enjoyable than working on
an obscure part of a system nobody knows about besides the people you are
working for. You feel like you are making a lot more visible impact.

With all the disadvantages however, it is very cool to have the knowledge
toolkit for creating cool visual demonstrations and perhaps even games. Why you
ask? Because graphics is so notoriously hard to grok, people that look at your
graphics hobby projects will be a lot more impressed than if you showed them a
cool script you have made, or a browser extension that you wrote, or in some
cases even a smartphone app you wrote.

If you can master graphics it is a signal that you are capable of learning very
complicated abstract concepts, that you are capable of navigating dense API
with very scarce documentation, that you have dedication and patience. All of
these qualities are very highly valued in the workplace.

But aside from all of this, I believe that trying to work with graphics you will learn the value of organisation. I am going trough that right now, as I am experimenting with graphics my code goes out of hand and gets disorganised. An
