### And welcome to Pixels Of Awesome, my CAT125 Project

My name is Oleg and I welcome you to my journey towards learning graphics,
becoming a better programmer, stretching my brains from time to time and
getting more acquainted with demoscene community and eventually, perhaps, even
becoming a part of it.

  <strong>This is me:</strong>
    programmer, designer and a musician.

For a long time I have been thinking of taking on 3D Graphics seriously, and
every time I tried to do anything I was immediately swallowed by the sheer
amount of knowledge I had to acquire to get even to the entry point.  Graphics
unlike much of software development requires solid understanding of math, and
hours upon hours of wrapping your mind around mostly very klutzy graphics APIs.
If Computer Science looks hard and has a tendency to drive a lot of beginners
away, Graphics is pure nightmare for a beginner.

That said I believe that learning at least a small subset of 3D graphics can
work work wonders for those who dare. You will be able to impress your peers,
act on your creative vision when it strikes you, and become more marketable as
you search for a new job.

The goal of this website is to give you a small glimpse into the history and
current state of the Demoscene community and introduce you to graphics programming.
