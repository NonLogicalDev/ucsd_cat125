  I made this track to go along with my first demoscene.<br/> 
  Which sigh... is not ready yet.

Yaho! Lost internet surfer! Glad to see you here! Oh wait, you must be
wondering what the hell is this... Fear not! I will start by answering that
very question. This is a website that I am doing for my college writing class
project. You are welcome to check out my [about][about] page for more info on
that.

Meanwhile let me say a thing or two about myself. I have always been amused by
the demoscene community and I know a couple people that are a part of it. It
pretty damn cool with all the parties that demoscene community is throwing. But
the most awesome part is the amount of ridiculously smart people that are a
part of it. The people that can bend the math to their will and make it follow
their lead and creative vision.

I am nowhere near that level, but I am slowly preparing my hiking boots to
start my journey down that thorny path, towards understanding graphics,
shaders, procedural world generation and game development, and I invite you to
come along with me for a ride....
